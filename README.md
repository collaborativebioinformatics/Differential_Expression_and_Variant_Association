## Connecting Risk Variants to Differential Expression
As bioinformatics begins to hone in on personalized medicine, one needs to look to the causes of differential expression. GWAS and other observational traits have helped uncover specific links between the human genome and human illness. Furthermore, teasing out differential expression across case and control groups has helped to start unraveling the genetics chronic diseases at a large scale. A good next step would start to guide efforts to explore causal relationships betwen the two. 
## Why should anyone care?
Such capability could eventually unlock this hackathon's ultimate vision of providing a clinician an easy way to allow their patients' genetics guide their treatment suggestion. To lay the foundation for such a massive undertaking we begin by delivering a simple method to start teasing correlations between differential expression and what we may believe to be their underlying causes.
## What does ViraVate do?
At its simplest level, it uses multiple correspondance analysis to help facilitate dimension reduction and highlight genes and variants to explore next. These variants can also provide a clinican and patient with more information. Additional features: ortholog mapping for researchers using model organisms, drug targeting, and gene ontology/pathway enrichment to provide further nuance to the factors considered in correspondance analysis.
