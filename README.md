## Goal
Develop a tool to connect common risk variants of a generic disease to the differential expression that drives its pathology.


# Connecting Risk Variants to Differential Expression

## RNASeq and Differential Expression
As bioinformatics begins to hone in on personalized medicine, one needs to look to the causes of differential expression. Out of the numerous ways to look at the differential genetics, RNASeq data in particular can be used in a wide array of computational analyses. One standard approach is to look at the differential expression of different genes by looking the mRNA produced from that gene.

## Whole Genome Approaches - Back to the Genetic Code
GWAS and other observational traits have helped uncover specific links between the human genome and human illness. Furthermore, teasing out differential expression across case and control groups has helped to start unraveling the genetics chronic diseases at a large scale.

## A Stymeing Point
While both of the approaches above are widely reported for a number of genes, connecting the two approaches remains elusive. Understanding differential gene expression does not reveal with great specficity the changes in the DNA responsible for a disease. In a symmetric manner, risk variants do not elucidate the precise effects on gene expression and symptoms that a patieny endures. A causal relationship between the two is hypothesized, but given the sheer number of genes implicated by either technique, finding a relationship could prove finding a needle in a haystack.

## Why should anyone care?
Well, if one can find the needles, it's not so mcuh of a stretch eventually unlock this hackathon's ultimate vision of providing a clinician an easy way to allow their patients' genetics guide their treatment suggestion. To lay the foundation for such a massive undertaking we begin by delivering a simple method to start teasing correlations between differential expression and what we may believe to be their underlying causes.

## What does ViraVate do?
At its simplest level, it uses multiple correspondance analysis to help facilitate dimension reduction and highlight genes and variants to explore next. These variants can also provide a clinican and patient with more information. Additional features: ortholog mapping for researchers using model organisms, drug targeting, and gene ontology/pathway enrichment to provide further nuance to the factors considered in correspondance analysis.

## Fine, but what does it really do?
You'll get a pretty picture once I make one in the morning (and appropriate text and removal of ADHD rambling).
